# LipidXplorer

LipidXplorer is a software that supports a variety of shotgun lipidomics experiments. It is designed to support bottom-up and top-down shotgun lipidomics experimenters performed at all type of tandem mass spectrometers. Lipid identification does not rely on a database resource of reference or simulated mass spectra.
